# Csvbuilder::Dynamic::Columns::Core

[Csvbuilder::Dynamic::Columns::Core](https://github.com/joel/csvbuilder-dynamic-columns-core) is part of the [csvbuilder-collection](https://github.com/joel/csvbuilder)

The Dynamic Columns Core contains the shared components used and extended by the Dynamic Columns Exporter and the Dynamic Columns Importer. It carries the architecture for the Dynamic Columns feature, and it canâ€™t be used alone.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add csvbuilder-dynamic-columns-core

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install csvbuilder-dynamic-columns-core

## Usage

The Dynamic Columns Core adds a new entry into the
DSL of the Model:

```ruby
class UserCsvRowModel
  include Csvbuilder::Model

  column :first_name
  column :last_name

  dynamic_column :skills
end
```

Here we indicate we will have length variable headers about skills in the CSV file. Important notes, only one dynamic column can be defined per model, and it must be placed after the regular headers!

The Dynamic Columns add two new methods to the Model:

```ruby
class BasicRowModel
  include Csvbuilder::Model

  class << self

    # Safe to override. Method applied to each dynamic_column attribute
    #
    # @param cells [Array] Array of values
    # @param column_name [Symbol] Dynamic column name
    def format_dynamic_column_cells(cells, _column_name, _context)
      cells
    end

    # Safe to override
    #
    # @return [String] formatted header
    def format_dynamic_column_header(header_model, _column_name, _context)
      header_model
    end
  end
end
```

The collection of Objects is expected to be provided through the context with a key of the same name as the declared dynamic_column.

## Development
